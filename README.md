Link files to Commence RM from Windows Explorer by drag-drop or Send To.

This repository contains ancient VB6 code I wrote 15 years ago. It is a utility to store file paths in Commence RM,
either by dragging them onto the application window or by using the Send To option in Windows Explorer.

There once was a helpfile but it got lost.

It still works fine on Windows 10.

I put it on GitHub for archiving purposes.
